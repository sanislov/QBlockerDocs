Introduction
############

| I started to work on QBlocker five years ago when I missed the quick object creation of 3ds Max. As a hobby project, it was free to download for many years.

| Now I decided to revive the development and release a new version as a paid addon.
| But to be fair with my users I want to keep the original one as a free addon and support it to stay compatible with the future releases of Blender.


What is QBlocker
################

QBlocker is an object creation addon for Blender to create parametric objects with fast placement similar to 3ds Max. The tool includes some basic object types, custom snapping and a working plane for more precision.
