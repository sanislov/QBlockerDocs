Introduction
############

| I started working on QBlocker back in 2019, when I missed the quick object creation workflow of 3ds Max.
| It began as a hobby project and was freely available for many years.

| Now, I've decided to revive development and release a new, improved version as a paid addon.
| To stay fair to existing users, the original version will remain free and continue receiving updates to maintain compatibility with future Blender releases.


What is QBlocker
################

| QBlocker is an object creation addon for Blender that enables fast, parametric object placement â€” inspired by the workflow of 3ds Max. It features:

* Basic parametric objects
* Custom snapping
* A working plane system for precision placement

| Whether you're blocking out environments or quickly prototyping shapes, QBlocker streamlines the modeling process with speed and control.
